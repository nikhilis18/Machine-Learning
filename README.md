###### Iris setosa    : [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_setosa)
###### Iris versicolor: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_versicolor)
###### Iris virginica : [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_virginica)

We have been provided with a dataset of 150 training examples (i.e 50 for each flower) with ‘4’ features for each flower. The features of the flowers are as follows :
###### Sepal length in cm
###### Sepal width in cm
###### Petal length in cm
###### Petal width in cm

We have to train our algorithm in such a way that it could classify any example into one of the 3 species. You can have a look at the dataset provided in the Iris_flower.txt file.
